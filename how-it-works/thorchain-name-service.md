# THORChain Name Service

### Overview

THORNames allow anyone to register cross-chain wallet addresses to a 1-30 long string of hexadecimal characters which include special characters `-_+` This makes them compatible to represent emojis ⚡️  
  
Users use a special memo and a THORChain `MsgDeposit` transaction to register their addresses. This then allows the system to lookup the name and retrieve the correct corresponding address for the specified chain. 

### Fees

There is a one-time registration fee of around 10 RUNE, with a 20 `tor` block fee, which works out to be around 1 RUNE annually. A user who pays 2 RUNE will then keep their name registered for 2 years.
