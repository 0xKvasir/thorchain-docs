# Continuous Liquidity Pools

Decentralised exchanges are notorious for having low or zero liquidity to the point where they can be unusable for low liquid pairs. This can also be the case for low-tier centralised exchanges. Instead of limit-order books, THORChain uses continuous liquidity pools \(CLP\). 

The CLP is arguably one of the most important features of THORChain. By building in on-chain liquidity the ecosystem receives the following benefits:

* Provides “always-on” trustless liquidity to all assets in the ecosystem.
* Functions as source of trustless on-chain price feeds to power all aspects of the ecosystem, including debt and lending.
* Generates arbitrage opportunities, further increasing asset liquidity.
* Allows users to trade assets at trustless prices, without relying on centralised third-parties.
