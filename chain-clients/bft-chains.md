# BFT Chains

### Assets

Assets on BFT chains are generally native tokens (not contract-based), and can pay their fee in their native tokens. Thus there is no router required.&#x20;

### Re-orgs

BFT chains do not re-org so no re-org logic is required.&#x20;

### Conf-counting

BFT chains do not require any confirmations.&#x20;

### Gas

BFT chains generally have static fees, so fee rates don't need to be updated regularly.
