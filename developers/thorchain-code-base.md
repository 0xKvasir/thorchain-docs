# THORChain Code Base

THORChain is a decentralised cross-chain liquidity protocol based on [Tendermint](https://tendermint.com/) & [Cosmos-SDK](https://cosmos.network/). 

THORChain uses [Tendermint ](https://docs.tendermint.com/master/nodes/)for BFT consensus and networking and extends the  [Cosmos-SDK](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.43/basics/app-anatomy.html) base app and creates its own module for specific logic handling.

## Getting Super Powers

Becoming a super hero is a fairly straightforward process:

```
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

{% code title="hello.sh" %}
```bash
# Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
{% endcode %}
